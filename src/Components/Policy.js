        <p>
          We value our customers and are committed to providing best services.
          Our clients need to realize that we do not offer a 100% guarantee on
          our calls and hence cannot offer any refund on subscriptions
          regardless of the individual client's performance. Once a service has
          been subscribed to and a payment has been made for the same, it can't
          be canceled or refunded in any case. If for some unforeseen reason,
          the client is not satisfied with our services, they may call us to
          seek direction on future calls. We will give our best effort to
          increase the satisfaction levels in such cases. However, any request
          by the client to cancel a service or get a refund will NOT be accepted
          in any case.
        </p>
        <p>We strongly recommend that before making a payment, our visitors and potential clients, please.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Read all information about our services and support given to our clients.</li>
        <li>Read our Terms and Conditions.</li>
        <li>Read our Privacy Policy and Refund Policy.</li>
        <li>There is no refund possible in any case whatsoever. </li>
